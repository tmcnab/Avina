        <h4>Another search engine?</h4>
        <p>Avina is a different kind of search engine. We don't crawl the web for every web page that has ever existed.
            Results that are added to search engine are from users who have installed the 
            <a href="/Info/Extensions">Browser extension</a>. So if someone
            has seen a web page, it's searchable from within Avina.</p>

        <h4>What does this mean?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If it's in Avina, a real <em>human user</em> has viewed the page</li>
            <li>The more <span class="badge badge-success">clicks</span> a page has, the more useful it has been to people searching for stuff</li>
            <li>The more <span class="badge badge-info">submits</span> a page has, the more people have visited it from their browser</li>

        <h4>How can I help?</h4>
        <p>The easiest thing you can do is install one of our browser extensions. Anywhere you go on the web, you send us a little chunk of
            data that tells us the website, how you got to it (referrer). At any time you can disable or remove this extension, and our extensions
            do not log you while in a positive privacy environment (Incognito).</p>

        <h4>What about Google?</h4>
        <p>Google has it's place as a comprehensive, exacting search engine and it does this through 
        <abbr title="Crawling is the process of trying to find each and every web site through brute force">crawling</abbr> the web. 
        Anywhere from zero to millions of people will have viewed a result in their index. </p>

        <h4>How do you make money?</h4>

            users who share data with us voluntarily or involuntarily.</p>
